The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of three different civic education campaigns using Facebook and Instagram among Tunisian citizens. By comparing each of the treatment arms with the control group, the research team will assess the effectiveness of each intervention on political knowledge, political interest, political self-efficacy, support for democratic norms and institutions, and intentions to participate in the coming 2019 elections.

The study will consist of an online randomised controlled trial targeting a total of at least 20,000 participants. The intervention consists of three different sets of videos on democracy, a placebo and a self-selected group (democracy or non-democracy videos). Participants within each treatment arm will be randomly selected for an extra task of writing-up short sentences on the videos they have watched.
