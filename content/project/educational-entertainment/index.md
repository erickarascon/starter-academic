This study testes whether framed educational videos using prospect theory and a practical guideline can be effective at increasing sexual education awareness. The videos are based on a story of fiction on condom use and sexually transmitted infections (STI). This online experiment consists of 3 treatment videos (Gain-framed, Loss-framed and Practical) and a placebo video. We expect these educational videos will increase the willingness to have a responsible sexual relationship, increase the knowledge of preventive measures and improve the participants' understanding on how STIs are transmitted. Additionally, if participants are loss averse, those exposed to the loss-framed treatment will react more strongly to the content than those facing the gain-framed treatment. Our expectations are that participants will engage more with the two framed (Loss and Gain) videos compare to the practical one as the first two develop an emotional narrative that may help viewers to engage more with the content and characters of the videos. We also expect that the practical video will be more effective at increasing self-efficacy beliefs about the correct way to use a condom as this is the only video that offers practical knowledge on the use of preventive measures.
